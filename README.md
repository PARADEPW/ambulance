Interactive Project Plan: Animal Ambulance Call Training Tool
This repository hosts an interactive single-page web application (SPA) that outlines the development plan for an Animal Ambulance Call Training Tool. This tool is designed as a game for the public to experience the challenges of working in an animal ambulance call center.

Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to create an interactive training tool in the form of a game. Members of the public can "play" this game to assess their readiness for working in the call center of the Amsterdam animal ambulance. The core of the project involves training an AI using recordings of real-life calls from the last three months. This AI will then "call" the player with a simulated problem, using an AI voice actor. The player and the AI will role-play until the player makes a decision on what to do next and successfully resolves the simulated issue.

Features of the Interactive Project Plan
This interactive web application allows users to:

View Project Overview: Get a high-level summary of the project goal, team composition, and estimated development timelines (MVP, Standard, Stretch).

Explore Detailed Phase Plan: Dive into each of the five development phases, understanding the specific steps, required technologies, and the "Definition of Done" for each task.

Review Technology Stack: See a categorized list of all the technologies proposed for building the training tool.

Understand System Architecture: Visualize the high-level technical architecture, illustrating how different components (frontend, backend, AI models, database) will connect and interact.

Technologies Used (for the Project Plan SPA)
This interactive project plan itself is built using:

HTML5: For the core structure of the single-page application.

Tailwind CSS: For a modern, responsive, and utility-first styling framework.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For all interactive elements, navigation, data handling, and dynamic content updates.

Chart.js: For rendering interactive and responsive data visualizations (e.g., development timelines).

Contributing
While this repository primarily serves as a project plan visualization, contributions to improve the plan's clarity, interactivity, or additional features for the SPA are welcome. Please feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
